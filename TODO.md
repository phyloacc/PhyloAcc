TODO:
- ~~Split the Hu-etal-2019 folder into a separate repo within the PhyloAcc organization~~ (completed 02.18.2022)
- What is _config.yml? Seems to be related to building the website. Figure out where it needs to go
- Update docs
- Update links
- Remake the original PhyloAcc web page so that the link in the paper is still active; this page can just point to the new repo or page
- Make release for these changes and update conda recipe (meta.yaml) to point to it
- Fork bioconda and upload recipe
- Add a simple way to test the PhyloAcc-ST binary, maybe --version option and/or a very small test dataset
- Remove .py extension from interface (difficult for Windows)
- Resolve or transfer interface issues
