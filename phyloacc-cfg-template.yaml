# This is a template configuration file for PhyloAcc.
# All options are listed here with a brief description and their default values.
#
# Options can either be specified here or in the command line, for example:
# phyloacc.py -a alignment.fa -b loci.bed -m model.mod -t species1;species2;species3
# is the same as setting those options in the configuration file and running
# phyloacc.py --config <config file name>
#
# IMPORTANT: Command line options take precedence over those specified in the configuration file!
# If neither are specified for a particular option, the default value will be used.
#
# This file is YAML formatted, meaning each option is a key-value pair, with the
# option name being on the left side of the colon and the value on the right side.
