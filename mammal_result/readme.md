The fold contains results for mammalian CNEEs.
Results for testing marine mammals specific accelerated CNEEs:
1. *Marine_elem_lik.txt* is the marginal loglikelihood under null, accelerated and full models.
2. *marine_top_5_5_post_Z.txt* is the posterior probabilities of Z and posterior median of substitution rates for marine-specific accelerated CNEEs (logBF1 > 5 & logBF2>5).
3. *marine_top_5_5.bed* is the bedfile for marine-specific accelerated CNEEs used as input to *GREAT*.
4. *top_5_5_marine_500KB_basal-MultipleOntologies.tsv* is the enriched ontologies for genes near marine-specific accelerated CNEEs output by *GREAT* (“Basal plus extension” up to 500Kb option).
5. *top_5_5_marine_500KB_basal_hg19-all-gene.txt* maps genes to  marine-specific accelerated CNEEs.
6. *top_5_5_marine_500KB_basal_hg19-all-region.txt* maps marine-specific accelerated CNEEs to genes.

Results for testing control mammals specific accelerated CNEEs:
1. *Control_elem_lik.txt* is the marginal loglikelihood under null, accelerated and full models.
2. *control_top_5_5_post_Z.txt* is the posterior probabilities of Z and posterior median of substitution rates for control-specific accelerated CNEEs (logBF1 > 5 & logBF2>5).
3. *control_top_5_5.bed* is the bedfile for control-specific accelerated CNEEs used as input to *GREAT*.
